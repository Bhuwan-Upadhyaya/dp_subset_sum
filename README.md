## CSE 3318 Lab Assignment 3

### Overview
This lab explores solving the two-subsequence subset sum problem using dynamic programming.

### Goals
1. Understand dynamic programming.
2. Solve two-dimensional subset sum problems.

### Requirements
- Identify two subsequences from an input sequence that match given target sums.
- Ensure indices of subsequences are in descending order.
- Display appropriate messages if no solution exists.

### Key Functionalities
- **Dynamic Programming Matrix:** Build a DP table to track subset sums.
- **Subsequence Extraction:** Retrieve subsequences using backtracking.
- **Error Handling:** Display messages for unsolvable cases.

### Compilation
```bash
gcc -o lab3 lab3.c
```

### Execution
```bash
./lab3 < input.txt
```
